    "bio": "Hello, my name is Elijah Soladoye, and I'm a full-stack developer with over four years of expertise who knows how to build applications with Django, Postgres, and React, among other technologies. I appreciate resolving issues, increasing customer satisfaction, and working with other developers to add value, and I'm always willing to learn more. Over the years, I've worked as a backend developer, a frontend developer, and a full-stack developer for a variety of organisations and clients. To promote optimal collaboration among developers, I believe that effective communication, discipline, work-life balance, and honesty should be maintained when working with individuals. I also feel that as a team player, one must be willing to make sacrifices in order to help the team when necessary.",
